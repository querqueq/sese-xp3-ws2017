# Developer Diary Definition

The developer diary should be written at least once per work day. If multiple tasks are done on one day and they aren't done in one session it is recommended to write multiple diary entries for the same day to better distinguish the situations that can occur while doing a task.

For example if an issue is done in the morning of a day and no problems arose and another one is done in the evening of that day than it makes perfect sense to write a diary entry just for that. Writing a lot of stuff in one entry can be more convenient for the developer but in reality it makes it hard to identify what was going on in the specific entry if the fist half talks about how smooth everything went and the second half about how everything went to hell. The diary entries should reflect things like slow development because of an inefficient aspect of our XP procedures or should simply state that everything went fine. Analysing the entries later on may lead to improvements of the overall workflow or simply a better understanding why something works or why it doesn't.

Every developer should should maintain their own diary as to not cause unnecessary version control issues. The diaries will be automatically merged and and converted to a Word document so please keep everything simple and tidy to prevent merge issues. Furthermore if issues are done using pairwise XP then both developers are required to write their own diary entry to ensure both perspectives are recorded.

## Focus Points

The following things should be taken into account when writing the diary:

* General project management issues (e.g. issue management on github)
* Issue estimates off by a lot (e.g. an issue is estimated with 6 story points and only 2 are needed)
* Issue understanding (especially when there were questions that where necessary to complete a task)
* Problems during implementation (e.g. missing background knowledge that another developer already has)
* Time management problems (e.g. another developer is required for a task but is not available)
* Merge problems and branching
* Problems during reviews (e.g. not able to understand what was done in a task due to missing background knowledge)
* Unclear responsibilites (e.g. when it's not clear who should do a review or who is responsible for a specific task)
* Changes requested by the customer breaks previous implementations (reflect on magnitude of changes necessary)
* Coding setup problems with emphasis on IDE
* Issue dependencies preventing oneself to implement a task

### Example Diary:
 
#### 05.11.2017

Defined format and procedure for the developer diary for isssue #8. Took longer than expected because it wasn't clear which information should be included in the meta data of the entry. Went with date only to keep it simple but that's what XP is all about isn't it?

#### 05.11.2017

Wrote the description for the developer diary. Should have done that before format definition because it was a lot clearer what should be included in it and in what form.
