# Developer diary definition

The developer diary should be written at least once per work day. If multiple tasks are done on one day and they aren't done in one session it is recommended to write multiple diary entries for the same day to better distinguish the situations that can occur while doing a task.

For example if an issue is done in the morning of a day and no problems arose and another one is done in the evening of that day than it makes perfect sense to write a diary entry just for that. Writing a lot of stuff in one entry can be more convenient for the developer but in reality it makes it hard to identify what was going on in the specific entry if the fist half talks about how smooth everything went and the second half about how everything went to hell. The diary entries should reflect things like slow development because of an inefficient aspect of our XP procedures or should simply state that everything went fine. Analysing the entries later on may lead to improvements of the overall workflow or simply a better understanding why something works or why it doesn't.

### Example diary:
 
#### 05.11.2017

Defined format and procedure for the developer diary for isssue #8. Took longer than expected because it wasn't clear which information should be included in the meta data of the entry. Went with date only to keep it simple but that's what XP is all about isn't it?

#### 05.11.2017

Wrote the description for the developer diary. Should have done that before format definition because it was a lot clearer what should be included in it and in what form.
