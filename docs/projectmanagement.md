# Project Management

The user stories are defined in the GitHub 
[Project page](https://github.com/sese-xp3-ws2017/sese-xp3-ws2017/projects/1).
These user stories get assigned story-points according to the needed development effort.

User stories get assigned to sprints and then split up into specific tasks (GitHub Issues). 
Tasks are assigned to the matching sprint milestone and assigned to users according to 
their priority.

After a sprint the tasks and time spend are analyzed and used to further perfect future 
story-point assessments.
